# Contracts gas comparison.

I noticed that deploying a simple ERC20 using [this popular generator](https://vittominacori.github.io/erc20-generator/) used up 4M gas.
That seemed too much, so I checked out the [Open Zeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/) contracts and they only use 1M. 
I'm going to be researching more contracts, some DAO related, some DeFi, to see if I can find some other inefficiencies.
